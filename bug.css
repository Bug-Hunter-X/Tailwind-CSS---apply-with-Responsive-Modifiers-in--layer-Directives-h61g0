The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a `@layer` directive, specifically when the applied styles contain responsive modifiers.  For example, applying a class that includes `md:bg-red-500` inside an `@layer` often fails to apply the styles correctly at the `md` breakpoint and beyond. The styles might apply at smaller screen sizes, but the responsive modifiers are ignored for larger ones.
