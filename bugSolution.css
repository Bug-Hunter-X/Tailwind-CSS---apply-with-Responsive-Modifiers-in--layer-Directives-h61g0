The solution involves moving the responsive modifiers out of the `@apply` directive. Instead of applying a class containing responsive modifiers, apply individual classes separately in order to utilize responsive features as intended. 

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
@layer base {
  .my-element {
    /* Base styles */
    background-color: blue;
  }
  @screen md {
    .my-element {
      background-color: red;  /* Styles for md breakpoint */
    }
  }
}
```
This approach ensures that Tailwind correctly applies the styles for each breakpoint.  Avoid nesting responsive modifiers within `@apply` statements within `@layer` declarations.
